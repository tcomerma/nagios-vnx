Scripts for monitorint EMC VNX Storage systems.

To be placed in the control station, and called using check_by_ssh from nagios.

Notes:
  * It's advisable to create a different user (nagios for instance) for monitoring, and create ssh keys for password-less login
  * You must use the -E switch ton check_by_ssh to skip the banner text from output
  
This scripts are barely tested. Feel free to improve them
